## About this repository

These are my solutions to [advent of code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) challenges.

#### Input files

Input files are not in the repository but the solutions are designed to take the input from stdin (when there is some input). I have followed the convention of putting input for `/python/dayXX.py` or `/ruby/dayXX.r` in the file `/input/dayXX.in` and a few solutions read the input from this file instead of STDIN since they run in interactive mode and need STDIN to ask user for input.
